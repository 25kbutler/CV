<h3>Bio</h3>

<p>There are a lot of things that I do at school and I want to tell you about them. I am a 9th grader at Sunset Junior High. I have a lot of friends. Usually when I first get to school me and my friends will hang out right by the front doors and there are a lot of us so it gets pretty crowded. I have 9 classes including rap, I really enjoy all of them, but my favorite class is English. I have always loved English because I really love to read and write so English is really entertaining for me. I love to help people which is why I am an office aid which is my second favorite class because you get to answer phone calls, help out the secretaries and whenever a parent is there to check out their child you are the one that goes to get the student. Usually after school me and my friends will normally go to the basketball home games or other home sport games which are really fun. It is amazing just standing on the bleachers and cheering on our school team. Normally it gets really loud and crazy, but that is what makes it fun. That is all about my life at school.</p>
<p>There are a lot of things that I do personally and I want to tell you about them. I live with 4 people which are my mom, dad, sister, and grandpa and we also have 3 pets which are our dogs Remi and Jet and my grandpa’s dog Rocky. I hang out with my family a lot. Usually, every Wednesday night we have family come over and we always eat and then usually just talk.  I have a passion for Volleyball, so usually every day when it gets a little bit cooler outside, I will go and play in my backyard, but during the winter time I will usually play in my garage because it is a lot warmer. During the Summer me and my family go camping almost every weekend and I love it. I love to hang out with my friends. Normally on Friday nights me and my friends are always hanging out, sometimes we go somewhere or we just stay at one of our houses and do something. I really enjoy hunting. Every October my dad and grandpa will take me hunting and I enjoy it so much. I don’t know what it is but I just love to search for deer, it's so entertaining for me. That is my personal life.</p>
